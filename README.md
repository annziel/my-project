# Paintagram

Want to know what famous painters Insta profiles would look like? Check out this app - [Paintagram](https://annziel.github.io/paintagram/)!

It's one of my solo projects during The Frontend Developer Career Path on Scrimba.

## The original requirements and my customizations:

This was meant to be HTML & CSS project (the design was provided via Figma), but I've jumped straight into the advanced version of the challenge and rendered all posts using JavaScript! 

Thanks to that, new posts can be easily displayed on the website.

In JavaScript, it was all about `.createElement`, `.className`, and `.textContent`. Additionally, I've ensured the number of likes is displayed using my local number format. I've also added `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active` CSS effects. Finally, I've renamed the app from "Oldagram" to "Paintagram" to refer to the community of the app's "users".

The app has an interactive feature â€“ click the heart under the posts you like and see the effect! (you can also change your mind.)
